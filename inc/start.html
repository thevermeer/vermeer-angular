<h4>Developing Innovation & Brands in Production</h4>
 	Forging new ground as a Product Designer and Software developer, I am seeking opportunities to make use of my divergent skillset.<br>

 	<h4>Honing the Cutting Edge</h4>
 	In order to demonstrate the new frontiers of possibility for both design and development, this site is being used as a sandbox for my next generation of innovation with the Angular.JS front-end javascript platform.
 	The site, in its first iteration, was designed and deployed in 7 days making use of a LAMP server hosting Angular.JS and JQuery in the front-end.
 	The content will be managed through Concrete5, an open-source CMS that I have been proudly implementing for 2009 and have used as the foundation for 2 major applications, working for RadiantGroup Media and the Om Reunion Project.
 	I plan to subsequently put the template on Github and the Concrete5 Marketplace for free download.
